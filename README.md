# GLIPH_specificity_figure
GLIPH_specificity_figure takes the specificity table and creates a correlation plot to visualize how closely related each motif is related in relation comparing two variables.

The figure generated shows where each cluster is in comparison to each of the two specified variables. The closer a dot is to the X or Y axis shows how closely it is related to its variable. The farther out the motif is signifies how large the cluster is. The figure is generated by being run on the specificity table that is created from the GLIPH_specificity_table.R algorithm.
